This project was partly created because of SMG going to a premium paid model, but more significantly, this was created for people that just want to scrape song and artist titles from Spotify.

Recently (Version 1.0.5, released on May 19, 2015), Spotify added the functionality to show the "Song Title - Artist" in the title of its window. This addition is what made this program easy to create.

* Support for other media players that work similarly to Spotify

For the a while, I see myself working on this project until I get it a little bit more flexible and feature complete. This means I will be monitoring this project for any issues that people report. I will be advertising this project more in the future, since it is only in alpha right now. Don't let this deter you if you really need a program to scrape spotify! It is fully working.

I am looking for any comments or criticism. Feel free to open an issue or tweet me! (@_dandruff)

I am not accepting any donations for this project, mainly because I like my free time and don't want this to become one of those projects. Any kind words is a good enough tip. Thank you for the thought though!
